    <h1>My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
    <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy activities that keep me engaged, active, and creative. These hobbies reflect my personality and the way I approach challenges both personally and professionally.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hunting</strong> – I enjoy hunting with my father, a tradition that’s helped me build patience, discipline, and focus. It’s also a great way to spend time outdoors. Learn more from the <a href="https://www.nwf.org" target="_blank">National Wildlife Federation</a>.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Woodworking</strong> – I love designing and building furniture or home decor by hand. It allows me to be creative and build something from scratch. Explore ideas on <a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com" target="_blank">Popular Woodworking</a>.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Fitness & Staying Active</strong> – Whether it’s weightlifting, bodyweight workouts, or just going on hikes, staying fit helps me maintain balance and energy. I get tips and motivation from <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com" target="_blank">Bodybuilding.com</a>.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong> – I like figuring out how things work or fixing broken tools or equipment. It’s a great way to apply critical thinking and learn something new with every challenge.</li>
    </ul>
